# Instructions
An awesome cross-platform chat-app. There is one chatroom where both IOS and Android users can rant to their heartâ€™s delight. For the Android version see [**Sander's awesome Android implementation**](https://github.com/grelon/sander-pset6)
# Noteworthy to mentions

### Thanks to the developers off [**JSQMessagesViewController**](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)
JSQMessagesViewController is a API that provides the functionality to display a
bubble view to display text messages.

### Inconsistency in naming scheme.
There is some inconsistency with the naming scheme
the terms `displayname` and `userName` are used interchangeably.<br/>
Reasons:<br/>
- Together with the Android developer we decided on a fireDatabase datastruction.<br/>
- On ios i was bound by the JSQMessages protocal.
