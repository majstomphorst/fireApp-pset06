# Instructions
An awesome cross-platform chat-app. There is one chatroom where both IOS and Android users can rant to their heartâ€™s delight. For the Android version see[**Sander's awesome Android implementation**](https://github.com/grelon/sander-pset6)
# Noteworthy to mentions

### Thanks to the developers off [**JSQMessage**](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)



### Inconsistency in naming scheme.
There were some inconsistency with the naming scheme between the terms `username` and `displayname` some times used interchangeably.<br>
Reasons:
Together with the Android developer we decided on a fireDatabasedatastructure.<br>
On IOS, I was bound by the JSQMessages protocol.
